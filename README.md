Objective: The Main aim of the project is to find the most influential factor that affects Covid-19.


Project Summary: 
COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Its rapid global spread resulted in significant fatalities worldwide. For this project, data on COVID-19 deaths in England, categorized by boroughs along with their local authority codes, was collected. Four key themes - Dwelling, Health, Economic, and Age - were selected and merged into a unified dataset using SQL Lite, utilizing the left join function for integration. Notably, this dataset was devoid of any missing values. The death count serves as the dependent variable, while other factors represent the independent variables. A sample of 1000 data points was chosen for normalization, employing methods like Softmax Scaling, Z-Score, and Min-Max scaling, along with outlier replacement. Softmax scaling yielded optimal results, normalizing the data within a range of 0.4 to 0.6 post-outlier removal. The normal distribution of variables was assessed using the Ks test and visualized using ggplots, bar plots, and histograms. Spearman correlation was utilized to identify highly correlated variables with the dependent variable, further depicted via a correlogram map. Subsequently, internally correlated independent variables underwent examination, followed by partial correlation analysis between two independent variables and the dependent variable. Notably, the highly correlated 'Bad Health' variable was subjected to regression analysis alongside the dependent variable, employing Linear and Poisson Regression models. These regression techniques aim to elucidate the relationship between COVID-19 deaths (dependent variable) and the independent variables.
